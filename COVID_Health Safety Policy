COVID-19/Health & Safety Policy

Overview:
The health and safety of our project community members are of utmost importance. In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and for general well-being, we have established the following guidelines to ensure the well-being of all participants in our open-source project.

COVID-19 Guidelines:
1. Remote Collaboration: Whenever possible, all project-related activities, including meetings, workshops, and events, will be conducted online to minimize in-person interactions.
2. Mask Mandate: In situations where in-person meetings are necessary, participants must wear masks at all times, especially when physical distancing is not possible.
3. Physical Distancing: Maintain a minimum distance of six feet (or as per local guidelines) from others during in-person interactions.
4. Hand Hygiene: Practice regular handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Hand sanitizers will also be made available at physical events.
5. Symptom Monitoring: Participants are expected to monitor themselves for symptoms of COVID-19. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing should refrain from attending in-person events.
6. Vaccination: While vaccination is encouraged, it is not mandatory. However, participants who are eligible and able to receive the COVID-19 vaccine are strongly encouraged to do so.
7. Travel Restrictions: Participants are encouraged to avoid non-essential travel, especially to areas with high infection rates.

General Health & Safety Guidelines:
1. Respect Individual Comfort Levels: Participants should respect each otherâ€™s comfort levels regarding in-person interactions. Some individuals might have health concerns that necessitate additional precautions.
2. Mental Health Support: The project community will provide resources and support for mental health and well-being, recognizing the impact that remote work and the pandemic may have on individuals.
3. Flexible Work Arrangements: Participants are encouraged to communicate their needs regarding flexible work arrangements to accommodate health and safety concerns.
4. Regular Updates: The project administrators will provide regular updates regarding health and safety guidelines, ensuring that all participants are informed of any changes.

Compliance:
All project community members are expected to comply with these guidelines to ensure the health and safety of themselves and others. Failure to comply may result in appropriate actions, including being asked to leave in-person events.
